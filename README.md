Online real-time chat powered by Node.JS

Chat allows anyone to join and send real-time messages to everyone currently in the group. This project was more of a proof of concept than anything, but it would be pretty simple to scale out to user accounts, private chats, and group chats with different users.

To run on localhost (Windows):
0. Make sure you have Node.JS installed (I am using version 0.10.31).
1. Open "server.bat" -- this runs a simple command: "node app.js". This starts the server.
2. Navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser.
3. You're done!

NOTE: If you make changes to the app.js file, you will need to restart the server before the changes take effect. However, if you're just making changes to the index.html file, you should see the changes by simply refreshing the page.
